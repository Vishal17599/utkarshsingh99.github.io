### 18:00 - Back to Competitive Coding

SPOJ - [Problem3](http://spoj.com/problems/CODEM3).

Question is unsolved as of now. Thinking of algo.

## Why I should be doing competitive coding?

Anyone can design a web page and make it look wonderful using CSS. But to make some really great life-changing or world-changing projects, one has to be willing to work with all of their brains,
and to think the unthinkable. I always feel that when I am doing the problems of CP, somewhere I am improving my intelligence and IQ even more. And that's what is absolutely needed.  
That's why CP is one thing that I should never ever be giving up.  

And that's it, just an incomplete SPOJ question for today.
