It's Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

### 13:10 pm - Ideation Phase

So a JavasScript Calculator should be quite easy in its core code, and since I finished my yesterday's aim in half the day, I think I should take stuff to a higher level, that is, allow my mind to flow freely to display its creativity. All the calculators have the same fashion of buttons. I could have a circular pattern of number buttons, like the old fashioned telephones.  
And the Addition, Subtraction, etc buttons will be inside the circle.  
Just recently, I saw this JARVIS reactor core design by the [Flying Emu](https://codepen.io/FlyingEmu/pen/dJymh), and I was able to make out the design needed for creating a circle. 
Only thing is that he/she has used SCSS, and I don't know if I should really be using it or not. 

Anyway, so there's that, and then what's next will be a greyish basic calculator screen, or a transparent black screen (since the background is being kept black). Digital Font will tell the user what they are typing. 

Next is the history what I'm thinking of. All calculator history will be coming on the right side of the calculator. And to the right of the history, there should be a 2D box informing the user of the features of the page.

### 13:30 pm - Diving In

1. Create index.html and calc.js. Include p5, bootstrap, jquery.
2. Build the circular number display
3. Build the +,-,/,* buttons.
4. Build the screen.
5. Put the core code into the calc.js file to display results.
[Optional]
6. Calculation History display.
7. Notes for help.
