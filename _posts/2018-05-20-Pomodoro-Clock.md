#### Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge

### 14:40 - Pomodoro Project Begins

Task Listing: 
1. Make index.html and include p5, jquery and bootstrap. 
2. Construct main.css and pomo.js file.
3. In pomo.js, make setup and draw file.
4. In index.html, make a div that maps the entire page length.
5. Add canvas.parent() in setup file, and then begin the core code.

### 15:45 - Base tasks done

However, the core code is troubling me. I'm somewhere just stuck in using p5 and getting all entangled in its draw() function's refresh rate.

I think I should forego p5 for this project, as I have done in all my previous ones, and use it later for designing.

### 19:00 - Reinitiating code attempt using setTimeout function
