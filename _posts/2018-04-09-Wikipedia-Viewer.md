Let's keep the flow! I completed the Local Weather challenge in one day and I'm so proud of it! Today I'll go with the next challenge, that is building a Wikipedia Viewer using Wikipedia's API.  
But before that, let me just add the background change animation and a new background image as default in my previous project.

It's been 30 minutes and the opacity access of body tag through JS isn't working. I'll have to drop the idea.

### 4:30 pm
Although I started with the Wikipedia API, I couldn't quite get the hang of it based on the user stories I had to fulfill. Obviously it can be done, but it'll take some hours which I can't spare today. I'll watch The Coding Train's video about this, and I'll get back to this.  

So I'll just go with completing the Intermediate Algorithm Challenges. Maybe just one for today: "Pig Latin".

Some hint functions:
>The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
>The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
>The join() method joins all elements of an array (or an array-like object) into a string and returns this string.
>The substr() method returns the part of a string between the start index and a number of characters after it.
>The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings, using a specified separator string to determine where to make each split.


Here's the question:
```
Translate the provided string to pig latin.

Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".

If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.

Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase.
```
A very interesting question with gooood testcases. Here's an example:

> translatePigLatin("glove")

Output:
>oveglay

Done! The problem is done! I won't do more problems since I have got other stuff to do [ACADEMICS].
Anyway, hope I can get my hands on the Wikipedia API tomorrow.
