Despite my low confidence, low chances and obvious late start, I have decided to go for proposal drafting for my project.  
Let's first have a look at IRC. I think I need to register for this thing and the process looks quite different.
Well, I didn't spend much time on this since this doesn't look so important. There are other ways of communication. So let's move on to my second obstacle.  
**Making an extension**  
I need to practice making extensions and they should be really great. In short, I need to master making and designing extensions. I started slow, by
following the steps on [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension), and made the first extension.
I thought that I could change the borders around any WebPage by changing the "matches" in the manifest.json file, but it doesn't work!  
Okay, maybe I need to practice more. What's the good thing here?  
I actually made an extension that works! So, let's move on to the [second extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension) on the site, a more complex one.  
I need to remember that the extensions which I'm learning could differ from the extensions and the required code used in Chrome, the primary priority for
my project in GSoC. Anyway, since the documentation here is better, I'm still gonna follow this initially.
