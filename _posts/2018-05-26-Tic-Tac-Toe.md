#### Day 10 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge

### The Plan

Since it's quite a tough project for me, sub-plans are really important.

1. Make divisions in HTML page, create a box for the play.  
2. First design algo only to check the winner, that is, design a 2 player game.
3. Then make algorithm for one player, but with random input by machine. 
4. If time permits, design proper algo for computer vs human.
