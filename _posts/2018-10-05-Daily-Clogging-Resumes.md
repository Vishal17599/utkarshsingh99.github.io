### Okay, you can call it a comeback

It's been a while since I've touched code, I guess a week now, and it's been a really really long time since I've blogged about my daily coding.
It has always been fun to do that. The truth is right now, I have no idea what I want to do as a side project. I need time to reframe my thoughts and make a new plan,  
and make sure this time I don't change it. As I look back, I've made newer plans, changed it again because of someone else's opinion and kept doing that recursively.  

This time, it's going to be one plan, and I'll run after it like a madman!
Okay, so here's what is happening right now:
I will keep coding and be in the development stream but, give considerable amount of my time to learning algorithms and data structures.
For example, the current Discrete structures, OOP and Probability subjects in this semester are the major courses that can guide my coding knowledge.
So I'll put in more efforts in those, more than what is required according to the curriculum.
Okay, having said this, it won't ve wrong to divide my day into academics till 6 pm and then coding development and doing side projects from 6 pm to midnight.  

Now the question is, I want to do a side project that is unique, and that uses MongoDB and NodeJS both so I can practice both these skills.  
There's a high chance I might forget those given the amount of time I haven't done anything worthwhile in them!  

### Ideation

So my search for a good project is on. What I think might be a possibility is,
I can improve on the existing GetIntoCLub project which we had made and link it with MongoDB.

1. Change the server code and make a proper login page code.
    - First learn JWTs
    - Implement them in all your requests and responses to make the project really really secure.
2. Link the code with database
3. Change UI of the site and make it more audition friendly.
4. Learn D3.js and Implement data visualisation techniques.
5. Perfect the project, finish it, and then share it on your LinkedIn profile!

The last step seems to be the toughest, since I never ever do that. The main aim of this project is to perfect the last point, and not get bored with the project.

### Dividing the Project into tasks and deadlines

1. Learn JWTs
    - Learning JWTs might take a few hours, so I should keep the deadline of this on Sunday
2. Implementation of JWTs could take some time since I don't know how well I would grasp that new stuff. So I think, this could be done till Wednesday,
taking into account all the possible lectures that might take place.
3. Adding MongoDB will be interesting, but quite shorter. I'll make this till the next Friday.
4. The UI will obviously be improved by the end of the next weekend.
5. Now comes the newer part, D3.js. Let's give this a week before the next weekend, that is till Friday.
6. Perfecting it can take any amount of time, no promises.
7. Learn AWS and try hosting the site.

| Task      | Deadline     |
|-----------|--------------|
|Learn JWT  | 7th October  |
|Implement JWTs| 10th October |
|MongoDB Linking | 12th October |
|UI Improvisation | 14th October |
|D3.js | 19th October |
|Finishing | Eternity |

So that's it, development is planned for October. Now let's get going with Academics too.

### Academics

There are 6 subjects:
1. Discrete Mathematics
2. Probability, Statistics and Queuing Models
3. Object Oriented programming
4. Digital Electronics
5. Microprocessors
6. Computer Graphics

Of these, only the first 3 are important for the future. And I have plans to implement Discrete Structure algos and structures in JS. So that goes in my ToDo straightaway.
Since I have made plans till approximately 19th October, I'll make plans for Academics till that date as well.

The most lost subject is Computer Graphics. Every day, for 1 hour, I'll study Discrete Maths from the Kenneth Rosen book.

Another 90 minutes must be devoted to reading OOP from the prescribed book because there are subtleties in it that I'm unaware of. This includes coding in C++ too since JS is very much different from this.

Okay, let's take up the rest of the subjects one by one and keep revising and studying them daily. Tomorrow will be the day for Microprocessor.

Done, all the planning is fine now. Let's get back into the game. Today night is going to be blogging night!
