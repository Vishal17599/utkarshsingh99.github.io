Hmm, I don't know if I'll make it to GSoC, I don't know if I should try getting into it this year,
but I do know that if I get a good organization, I will learn a lot from it. So, I'm gonna at least try.

So I opened the organizations list, and I'm applying a filter for Web Development.
The first one, AOSSIE.
They had a list of ideas that they are putting up. At the end, they gave guidlines for submitting project proposals.

>Name: Email: Skype/Facebook/Google+: Phone: Address: University: Degree: Expected Graduation Date: How many hours will you work per week? Other Commitments: (e.g. exams, projects, jobs, theses... How will you prevent them from affecting your GSoC performance?)
>Chosen Idea:
>Proposal Description: (it should be more detailed than the chosen idea's description, to ensure that you have understood it.)
>Timeline: (be concise and realistic)
>Community Bonding (23/04 - 14/05):
 Week 1 (14/05 - 20/05):
 Week 2 (21/05 - 27/05):
 Week 3 (28/05 - 03/06):
 Week 4 (04/06 - 10/06):
>First Evaluations
 Week 5 (11/06 - 17/06):
 Week 6 (18/06 - 24/06):
 Week 7 (25/06 - 01/07):
 Week 8 (02/07 - 08/07):

>Second Evaluations
 Week 9 (09/07 - 15/07):
 Week 10 (16/07 - 22/07):
 Week 11 (23/07 - 29/07):
 Week 12 (30/07 - 05/08):
 Week 13 (06/08 - 12/08):

>Final Evaluation
>Why are you the best person to execute this proposal? (demonstrate that you satisfy the requirements for the chosen idea.)
>Contributions: (list and link any pull requests to your chosen project)
>For which projects have you worked? (For each project: write a few sentences describing what the project does; mention the programming languages used; describe your contributions; include a link to the project's code repository)
>Which relevant courses have you attended at the University? How was your performance?
>Any Other Relevant Information:

Now if I have an idea, I don't understand what I will be writing in the Community Bonding part, and the First and Second Evaluations.
Let me see a sample application proposal.
From Google's github blog,

> Include a brief, clear work breakdown structure with milestones and deadlines.
Make sure to label deliverables as optional or required. You may want your plan to start by producing some kind of white paper,
or planning the project in **traditional Software Engineering** style. It’s OK to include thinking time (“investigation”) in your work schedule.
Deliverables should include investigation, coding and documentation.

The only good, interesting project that I found matching up to my skills was [Mind The Word](http://aossie.org/#ideasModal6).  
They don't have a specific idea, its just one: Make better UI for the extension.  
Hmm, now they have their project on gitlabs instead of github. So first step is registering myself on gitlabs.  
Hmm, I linked my github to gitlabs, and now, I have to find worthy issues and submit my PRs to be in their sight.  
Before that, I must explore the extension. When I click on 'Options', I had to get an API key.  
The point is, it took me a while to figure out what is happening. It should be an easy task for average people to understand what they have to do.
Especially if one is form a non-CS background, they might find it difficult to understand what an API is, and to get a key, then paste it in some form which doesn't
even look like one; it's pretty difficult. So my first sub-idea would be to change the main page design.
Now, what if I open up a page that is in a different language, but I want to increment or decrement the percentage of the words being translated.  
I could keep a shortcut option to do that.
In the issue of [Localizing an extension](https://gitlab.com/aossie/MindTheWord/issues/36), I might find a way to link it to Sanskrit or rather Tamil and Telegu, since they are needed a lot in India and there are a lot of sites in that language.
Okay, bad news, they have already been added in the markdown files. I need to stick with the alternative API issue then.  
Before all this, I think I should first learn how to build a proper extension from scratch.
