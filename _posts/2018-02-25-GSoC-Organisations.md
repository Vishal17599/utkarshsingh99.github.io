Hmm, I don't know if I'll make it to GSoC, I don't know if I should try getting into it this year,
but I do know that if I get a good organization, I will learn a lot from it. So, I'm gonna at least try.

So I opened the organizations list, and I'm applying a filter for Web Development.
The first one, AOSSIE.
They had a list of ideas that they are putting up. At the end, they gave guidlines for submitting project proposals.

>Name: Email: Skype/Facebook/Google+: Phone: Address: University: Degree: Expected Graduation Date: How many hours will you work per week? Other Commitments: (e.g. exams, projects, jobs, theses... How will you prevent them from affecting your GSoC performance?)
>Chosen Idea:
>Proposal Description: (it should be more detailed than the chosen idea's description, to ensure that you have understood it.)
>Timeline: (be concise and realistic)
>Community Bonding (23/04 - 14/05):
 Week 1 (14/05 - 20/05):
 Week 2 (21/05 - 27/05):
 Week 3 (28/05 - 03/06):
 Week 4 (04/06 - 10/06):
>First Evaluations
 Week 5 (11/06 - 17/06):
 Week 6 (18/06 - 24/06):
 Week 7 (25/06 - 01/07):
 Week 8 (02/07 - 08/07):

>Second Evaluations
 Week 9 (09/07 - 15/07):
 Week 10 (16/07 - 22/07):
 Week 11 (23/07 - 29/07):
 Week 12 (30/07 - 05/08):
 Week 13 (06/08 - 12/08):

>Final Evaluation
>Why are you the best person to execute this proposal? (demonstrate that you satisfy the requirements for the chosen idea.)
>Contributions: (list and link any pull requests to your chosen project)
>For which projects have you worked? (For each project: write a few sentences describing what the project does; mention the programming languages used; describe your contributions; include a link to the project's code repository)
>Which relevant courses have you attended at the University? How was your performance?
>Any Other Relevant Information:

Now if I have an idea, I don't understand what I will be writing in the Community Bonding part, and the First and Second Evaluations.
Let me see a sample application proposal.
From Google's github blog,

> Include a brief, clear work breakdown structure with milestones and deadlines.
Make sure to label deliverables as optional or required. You may want your plan to start by producing some kind of white paper,
or planning the project in **traditional Software Engineering** style. It’s OK to include thinking time (“investigation”) in your work schedule.
Deliverables should include investigation, coding and documentation.
