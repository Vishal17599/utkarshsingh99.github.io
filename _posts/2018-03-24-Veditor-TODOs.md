I'm listing out the basic stuff that we need to do for this application.
1. Design layout first; as the previous one or make improvements.
2. Enter code of previously coded voice recognition
3. Side buttons code
    1. Original Layout buttons
    2. Mini layout inside buttons
    3. Java linking of original and mini layouts
4. Add lines of code.
