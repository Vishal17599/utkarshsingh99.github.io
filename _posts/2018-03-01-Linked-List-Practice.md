Hmm, I must begin by confessing that although I know what a Linked List is, and have read algorithms about this,  
I have never fully made my own program implementing it.  
I had looked at the code of this quite some months back, long enough for me not to remember it. So I'm going to implement it first as a simple
program before moving on to CP.

So, recollecting what I know from it, a Linked List is something which has a data value, and then a pointer to the next element.  
Now, first step is entering the data. If I run a loop, and while taking inputs into the value of the data structure, point the 'next' pointer of the
previously entered data structure to the current data structure, that should basically be it.
