So I have this Gemfile and Gemfile.lock which I have no idea about.
Still, let's just try the new themes by simple writing them under config.yml.
I'm gonna first check if the blog is actually changing when I change themes, so first, Architect theme.
Done.
The theme is working properly, but the only thing is I'm unable to add the theme directly through
>theme: jekyll-theme-architect

I have to copy the html code again and again. Hope I find out a shorter way.
Since selecting a theme is a one-time process, I'm not gonna loiter around this problem for too long.
