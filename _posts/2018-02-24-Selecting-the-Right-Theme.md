So I have this Gemfile and Gemfile.lock which I have no idea about.  
Still, let's just try the new themes by simple writing them under config.yml.  
I'm gonna first check if the blog is actually changing when I change themes, so first, Architect theme.  
Done.  
The theme is working properly, but the only thing is I'm unable to add the theme directly through  
>theme: jekyll-theme-architect

I have to copy the html code again and again. Hope I find out a shorter way.  
Since selecting a theme is a one-time process, I'm not gonna loiter around this problem for too long.  
Now instead of trying out each theme one by one by pasting it into the default.html, I simply previewed the themes.  
Hacker and Cayman top the list for me. The good thing about these themes are they are pretty stretched out unlike the other ines who  
have made the div too short for the content.  
I'm thinking of putting this to vote.  
Before that, let me preview both of these.  
Okay, I've put it to vote.  
I have decided now, I'm going with 'Hacker'
