### 11:40 am - Starting second project of FreeCodeCamp

So there's something called a Twitch TV and I have to use its API to give info about its live streams. Seems quite easy once you read the demo code.

All I will need is designing ideas. If I think about design before designing the core, I might end up losing concentration over the main stuff, thus making it difficult.

Aim: Complete the core of the project by 4 pm/5 pm and then give the rest of the day to design.

##### AFK at 11:45 am

### 12:10 pm - Initiating Core Project Code

1. Make index.html and twitch.js. Include bootstrap, jquery, p5.
2. Make row and column divisions and add channels in JS file.
3. Construct the output from the JSON API.

### 12:25 pm - Code resumes

Step 1 complete. 

### 1:45 pm - Core Project Complete

Now designing remains. 
I need a good heading, then a nice background[optional], and then I need heavy formatting in the Cards that I have made in the page.

##### AFK at 1:45 pm

### 2:30 pm - Designing Begins

SO let's begin with the design by first formatting the cardView class declared for each class.

### 3:20 pm - Designing Complete

Everything has been done. The page looks cute and functional, although not breathtaking.

Now I have to upload this on codepen.

So I have completed the challenge! Now I think I should take a break and celebrate!
