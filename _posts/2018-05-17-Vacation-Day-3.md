### 11:40 am - Starting second project of FreeCodeCamp

So there's something called a Twitch TV and I have to use its API to give info about its live streams. Seems quite easy once you read the demo code.

All I will need is designing ideas. If I think about design before designing the core, I might end up losing concentration over the main stuff, thus making it difficult.

Aim: Complete the core of the project by 4 pm/5 pm and then give the rest of the day to design.
