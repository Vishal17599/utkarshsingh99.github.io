Okay, it's Vacation Time!
Now, I've already deleted the html file posts into md files. A heads up to [Kartikay Kumar](https://github.com/Kartikay26) for telling me this, saved a lot of time.
I've got quite a lot of things in mind that I've got to do.
So let me just list out the things I want to be doing today.
> 1. Format the first post properly
> 2. Choose a theme for a blog. Architect is too novice. :/
> 3. Research about GSoC organisations.
> 4. Competitive Coding. At least 2 problems of Easy from Codechef.

Okay, now let's take a moment to pray that I may finish all of these tasks today.

So let's begin.
