Watched Coding Train's Wikipedia API challenge video

### 2:25 am
Started the code for the project.

Testing first search link.

Error: CORS Header missing.
Solution: Need to create a server to call API since a webpage cannot.

Let me first try it on codepen. Still the same error. Will have to see the demo code of freecodecamp to find out how they hosted it on codepen since in the end, even I have to put it out on codepen.

Watched other campers source code. They have used a different API link.

Project postponed again. Will crack this shit later.
