    <h1>Designing the Home Page</h1>
    <p>
      So I finally managed to open up a Blog on coding.
      Now to begin with the design first, I was thinking of adding up a pre-coded theme from the internet.
      Now I looked up something called Jekyll, a static site generator. The tutorial on Github said that you have to make
      changes to the _config.yml file in the main page of the repository. I can't find it though. :/
      Maybe the condition is that I have to first setup Jekyll. So let me just find out how to set it up in my PC and Github.

      So Jekyll might be the exact thing I'm looking for. It basically converts our input simple text into proper sites using its own CSS and HTML.
      This is exactly what I need, since I don't wanna be wasting a lot of time on decorating my blog, and keep formatting codes, snippets and help texts.
      I want all of these simply done by the editor.
      Now I'm putting in the commands for installation, we'll see how to use it later

       gem install jekyll bundler

       Now since gem isn't installed,

       sudo apt install ruby

       Ruby is installed, Voohoo!
       Now, when I'm trying the former command, the following error popped up:

       ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

       Apparently, I need to update the gem version again, and then try. This seems to be a problem of Mac Systems, don't know why I'm facing it!
       I installed the Jekyll and bundler applications, and they are up and running in the git repository.
