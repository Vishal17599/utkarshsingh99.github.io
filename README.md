# Utkarsh Singh's Coding B/Log

This site is basically a Log of my daily coding progress. This helps me to:
- Get a summary of what I have done for the whole day.
- Get a clear picture of the journey of the idea in my head to developing it into reality, passing through all the hurdles on the way.
- Take a look back at my coding progress, learning speed, and explorer capabilities.

This site will help you to:
- Learn all the things that I learn and make during the day of which you might not be aware of.
- Get an idea about the kind of programmer that I am, and maybe you might be able to give me a feedback on my methods, or recommend me to someone somewhere!
